<h1>ðŸ‘‹Welcome to my Github!</h1>
<br>
<p>Hello! My name is Sam, and I am a current third-year Bachelor of Computer Science student, affiliated with the University of British Columbia. ðŸ“– Before making my career transition into tech, I pursued and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences from Simon Fraser University in 2018, and also hold an Advanced Diploma in Clinical Genetics Technology from the British Columbia Institute of Technology. ðŸ”¬</p>
<br>
<p>After working in healthcare, I realized that current technological advancements - including, advents in Artificial Intelligence, bioinformatics, and clinical informatics - can positively improve overall care quality, and health outcomes. :hospital: I hope to one day use the skills I gain from my second degree to give back and make fruitful contributions to society and beyond ðŸŒŽ</p>

<br>
<p>ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm working on: The Missing Semester of Your CS Education</p>
<p>ðŸ’­ Right now, I'm hoping to: Build my portfolio webpage!</p>
<p>ðŸ˜„ I am open to working on collaborative projects and teaming up for hackathons</p>
<p>âš¡ A fun fact about me: I once lived in Japan for an 8-month internship, and did an overnight hike at Mount Fuji!</p>
