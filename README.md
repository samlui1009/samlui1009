<h1>Welcome to my Github!</h1>
<br>
<p>Hello! My name is Sam, and I am a current third-year Bachelor of Computer Science student, affiliated with the University of British Columbia. ðŸ“– Before making my career transition into tech, I pursued and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences from Simon Fraser University in 2018, and also hold an Advanced Diploma in Clinical Genetics Technology from the British Columbia Institute of Technology. ðŸ”¬</p>
<br>
<p>After working in healthcare, I realized that current technological advancements - including, advents in Artificial Intelligence, bioinformatics, and clinical informatics - can positively improve overall care quality, and health outcomes. :hospital: I hope to one day use the skills I gain from my second degree to give back and make fruitful contributions to society and beyond ðŸ’»</p>

  <list>ðŸ˜„ I am open to working on collaborative projects and teaming up for hackathons</list>
  <list>âš¡ A fun fact about me: I once lived in Japan for an 8-month internship, and did an overnight hike at Mount Fuji!</list>
